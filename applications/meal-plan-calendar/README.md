# Meal Plan Calendar

Shows a family meal plan ("Essensplan") that lives in a shared iCloud calendar. Every day gets a large
date and its meals grouped into breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Open slots appear as
"not planned yet".

Landscape frames show one column per day like a paper week planner; portrait frames show a vertical
list. Days that do not fit are left out from the end and counted in the footer.

## Setup

1. On iPhone/iPad open **Calendar → Calendars → (i)** next to the meal plan calendar
   (German: **Kalender → Kalender → (i)**), or open Calendar on iCloud.com and use the share button.
2. Enable **Public Calendar** (**Öffentlicher Kalender**) and copy the link via **Share Link…**.
   Sharing the calendar with family members at the same time keeps working as before.
3. Paste the `webcal://` link into `calendarUrl`. It is upgraded to HTTPS and fetched only on the server.

Without a link the integration shows clearly labelled sample data.

The public link is a read-only capability URL: anyone with it can read the calendar. The settings form
masks it, the render page sends it as a same-origin JSON `POST`, and it is never returned in the display
payload. Any other public HTTPS/Webcal iCalendar feed works as well; private or non-routable addresses
are rejected by the shared calendar transport.

## How entries become meals

| Calendar entry | Meal slot |
| --- | --- |
| Title prefix `Frühstück:`, `Breakfast:`, `Brunch:`, `☕` | Breakfast |
| Title prefix `Mittag:`, `Mittagessen:`, `Lunch:`, `☀️` | Lunch |
| Title prefix `Abend:`, `Abendessen:`, `Abendbrot:`, `Dinner:`, `🌙` | Dinner |
| Timed entry before 11:00 / 11:00–15:59 / from 16:00 | Breakfast / Lunch / Dinner |
| All-day entry without prefix | `allDayMeal` setting (dinner by default) |

Prefixes may also be written as `[Mittag] …` or `(Abend) …` and are removed from the displayed title.
Multi-day all-day entries (e.g. leftovers for two days) repeat on each day. Identical dishes in the
same slot are shown once.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `""` | Heading; empty uses "Essensplan" / "Meal plan". |
| `calendarUrl` | `""` | iCloud public calendar link (`webcal://` or `https://`). |
| `days` | `5` | Days to show (1–14). |
| `startDay` | `today` | `today` or `monday` of the current week. |
| `slots` | `lunch-dinner` | Slots shown as "not planned yet" when empty: `lunch-dinner`, `dinner`, `all`, `none`. |
| `allDayMeal` | `dinner` | Slot for all-day entries without prefix: `dinner`, `lunch`, `breakfast`, `other`. |
| `timeZone` | `Europe/Berlin` | IANA time zone for "today" and timed entries. |
| `showHeader` | `true` | Show title and sample label. |

`sampleData` and `now` are available for previews and screenshot variants.

## Design notes

- Today's date sits on an orange block (dithered on Spectra 6, black numerals); colored themes use
  their accent instead.
- Slot badges use native pigments: yellow with black outline for lunch, blue for dinner, green for
  breakfast. The footer legend names each slot, so color is never the only cue.
